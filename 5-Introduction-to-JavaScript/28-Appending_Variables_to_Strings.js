// You can also append variables to a string by using += operator

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = " is super fun!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
