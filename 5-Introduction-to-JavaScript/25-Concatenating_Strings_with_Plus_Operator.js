// When the + operator is used with a String value it's called a concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together. Concatenation does not add spaces between the strings, so you need to add them.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
