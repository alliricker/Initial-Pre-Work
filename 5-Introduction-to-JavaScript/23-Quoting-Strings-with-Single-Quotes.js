// Single and double strings work the same way, but you may want to use single quotes if you have double quotes (like a conversation) inside a string. If you have the same quote within the string, the string will end early and throw an error. Always use backslashes as an escape

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
