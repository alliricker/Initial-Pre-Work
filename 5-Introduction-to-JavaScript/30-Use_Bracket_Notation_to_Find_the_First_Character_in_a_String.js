// Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string. JavaScript starts counting at 0 (zero-based indexing) like most modern programming languages. Example- character at index0 in "Alli" is "A" or firstName[0] if firstName = "Alli"

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
