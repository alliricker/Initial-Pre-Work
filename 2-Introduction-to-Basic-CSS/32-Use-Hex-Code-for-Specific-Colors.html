/* Colors can be represented in CSS using hex (hexadecimal) code. Hexidecimals are base 16 numbers. 0-9 and A-F (ten to fifteen) are used to represent a digit in hexadecimal, totalling 16 possible values. 6 hexadecimal digits are used to represent colors - 2 each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. #000000 is black and the lowest possible value in the RGB color system. In this example, I replaced the word black in the body element with the hex code, yielding the same result of a black background. */

<style>
  body {
    background-color: #000000;
  }
