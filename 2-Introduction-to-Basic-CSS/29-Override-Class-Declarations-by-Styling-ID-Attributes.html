/* Browsers read CSS from top to bottom. If there is a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last. However, you can override CSS with id attributes. In this example, h1 is given the id attribute orange-text that will override the green, blue, and pink text. The CSS declaration for orange-text can be placed above or below the pink-text attribute in the style element, the order will not matter in this case as id attribute will always take precedence. */
