/* To override the pink text, add an additional CSS class blue-text below the pink-text declaration. Applying multiple class attributes is donw with a space in between them - class="class1 class2". It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element, but the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is important. The second declaration will always override the first, in this case .blue-text will override .pink-text as it is declared second. */
