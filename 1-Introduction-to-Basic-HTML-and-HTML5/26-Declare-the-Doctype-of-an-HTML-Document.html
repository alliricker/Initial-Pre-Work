<!-- When you declare the Doctype of an HTML document, HTML 5 is declared simply as html (not case sensitve). Older web pages may use previous versions of html. Then, the code needs to be wrapped in <html> tags, opening tag goes directly below the DOCTYPE and the closing tag at the bottom of the page -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<h1> Hello World! </h1>
</html>
