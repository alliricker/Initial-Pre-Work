# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.

When I hit the link, the website opens in the browser. The client (my computer) is requesting information from the server (the website.) The URL provides information on how to find the information in the internet and how to read it. The https:// indicates that I am using the web to access the website. The domain name is assigned to an IP address, which is the information that the computer uses for identification. The HTML document is displayed in the browser, and I can see and read the homepage for Techtonic.

Note: I used the source https://marksheet.io/introduction.html for information for this answer.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

The data is provided by the server. The server stores websites, which I access by typing a URL into my browser. The domain name of the URL is rented from a domain registrar. An IP address is associated with the domain name, and that tells the computer where to go for information. The browser interprets the HTML code of the webpage and displays what I see on the other end.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

The code rendered in the browser is HTML.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

The server-side code's main function is to send information to the browser as requested. Data needs to be validated, stored, retrieved, and sent as necessary.

Note: I used the source https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction for information for this answer.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

The client-side code's main function is to provide the appearance and function of a webpage. The appearance can depend on the browser used; a website looks different on my new computer as opposed to my old computer or on a phone browser.

## What is runtime?

Runtime is the time in which a program or application is being used, or running. I am most familiar with the term "runtime error," which means that the code has a bug that occurs while the program is running.

Note: I used the source https://pc.net/helpcenter/answers/compile_time_vs_runtime for this answer.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

I'm not sure how to answer this question. I know that HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc are all used on the client-side, but they are likely limited by the browser type that is used.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

I'm also not sure how to answer this question. All server-side code must be available at any given time, even if it is not being requested.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

I'm not sure how to answer this question either! It seems as if the possible instances are infinite, though a very large number would likely be difficult to maintain.
